## data ingestion and knowledge graph construction phase, leveraging 

Neo4j

ChromaDB

LangChain

OpenAI.

## step 1
You've already handled the document cleaning, which is a great head start. Our focus now will be on:

## step 2
Document Chunking: Breaking down your cleaned full documents into meaningful, context-rich chunks suitable for both vector embedding and targeted NER.

## step 3
NER Pipeline & Graph Extraction: Using OpenAI's LLMs via LangChain to extract entities and relationships from these chunks and populate your Neo4j knowledge graph.

## step 4
Embedding & Vector Storage: Generating OpenAI embeddings for each chunk and storing them in ChromaDB.

## step 5
Orchestration: Using LangChain to tie these steps together into a coherent ingestion pipeline.
